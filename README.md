# 24h watch Pebble Watchface

I came up with this idea that's is only possible with a smartwatch.

Why the analog watches have two hands?<br>
Why show only 12h if we have 24h each day?<br>
Why should we care about all the other numbers if we only want to see the current hour and minute?<br>
Well, a digital watch shows us that e.g. (20:45). But the digital watches lacks visual data.
So I decided to join the best of the two worlds by creating this watch, with visual and digital data.

### Why Pebble?
Because is the most affordable javascript hackable smartwatch.<br>
Apple Watch doesn't allow custom watchfaces.
